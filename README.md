First run through of a quick todo program I will use for work. Trying Firebase out to store data.
Didnt get into dynamic updates because I barely understood how to handle Firebase as it was.
Needs to be refactors as the code is a mess, has jquery in some places but needs to be updated to only use jquery.
It works, but there is no error handling and very questionable programming practices.
Important to Note - this is the first real, if this is real, program I've written in javascript other than small stuff.
